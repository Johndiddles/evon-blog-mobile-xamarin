# Evon-Blog-Mobile

This blog is built with Xamarin Forms and C# upon a Django Rest Framework backend service.

A user is required to login or signup to use the application. Emails are not verified, so any email (valid or invalid) works.

For testing purposes,

```bash
username: evonmedics
# ...
password: evonmedics
```

To run this project locally, you need to have Visual Studio and an emulator instead (Android Studio) installed.

Then clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Johndiddles/evon-blog-mobile-xamarin
```

open the folder in Visual Studio

Click on run to open the mobile application in your emulator
